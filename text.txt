Quantum algorithms typically leverage superposition and entanglement to perform operations on multiple possibilities simultaneously.
This allows for exponentially faster computations in many cases.
The O(t) complexity in quantum systems would be the result of improvements in quantum state manipulation and
efficient quantum modular exponentiation (among other quantum tricks).
